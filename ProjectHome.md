this is the home of HQL Builder:
a tool to construct Hibernate HQL queries; HQL Builder is not a stand-alone program but rather a library to include in your project that uses hibernate to access the database; a separate client and (web)service is available but it runs well as a single program after being configured correctly and having access to the Hibernate entity classes and all necessary libraries of your project

**version 1 is finally released (version 1.0.2 is the latest version) and the download of the legacy project has been deprecated**

releases can be found here: https://hql-builder.googlecode.com/svn/maven2/

snapshots can be found here: https://hql-builder.googlecode.com/svn/maven2-snapshots/

the libraries not available on the official Maven repository can be found here: https://hql-builder.googlecode.com/svn/maven2/

you can check out the code from the Subversion repository and take a look at the "somethingsomething-test" modules how to setup HQL Builder (to include these modules in the build process, you need to use the profile "inc-test-modules", -Pinc-test-modules)
